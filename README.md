## Splash Page
When a user visits the website, they are prompted to either login using their credentials, login using the demo login, or create a new account. Either logging in or using the demo login will redirect the logged in user to the home page.

## Sign Up
When a user clicks the signup option from the splash page, they are redirected to a form to create a new account. Successfully creating an account will redirect them to the home page as a logged in user.

## Home Page
This is the first page a logged in user will see. There is an option to view all locations by clicking "I'm Flexible", and there are 4 preset cities to view locations from below. Clicking any of these buttons will redirect the user to a page displaying the appropriate locations. At the bottom of the home page, there is a link that redirects to the developer's (Omkar Mehendale) GitHub account. Similarly, there is a link that redirects to the developer's LinkedIn profile.

## NavBar
Logged in users will have access to the navbar, which is at the top of the page. This bar includes a return link to return immediately to the home page, a search bar to search for locations by city, state, or country, a host button that opens a modal to create a new location, and a logout button.

## Location Page
Clicking on a location will redirect the user to the single location page. This page will display all of the information about the location, including the name of the host, the images associated with it, it's description, amenities, and price. This page will also display reviews left by other users about this location.

## Explore
Clicking "I'm Flexible" from the home page will redirect the user to the explore page, which will display all locations for the user to peruse. Clicking any of these will redirect to the appropriate location page.
